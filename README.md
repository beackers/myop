## about
AREDN nodes have the power to communicate over mesh networks with TCP/IP using regular or ham-specific WiFi channels. Amateur radio operators can leverage this to their advantage when deploying as part of an emergency communications ("emcomm") group like ARES or RACES. This software specifically utilizes Python and a few commonly available libraries to host a small, efficient web server available to each node that concentrates information about the current incident and allows operators to use web browsers to send information that supplements other communications, like pictures or forms. By consolidating information and making it easily accessible, operators can communicate faster and more clearly.
