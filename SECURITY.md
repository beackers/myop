# Security Policy

Let me be very, very clear.

**I barely know what I'm doing.**

If you see something that ain't right, let me know and I will fix it. Point out what's going on, how someone could break in, everything you see. Because yes I do have a
computer scanning the code for me, but it only does so much. And I consider myself a rookie coder. One of the first commits to this project was to remove a line of code that
printed the secret token. That's how "rookie" I am.

So please. Let me know. Open an issue. Fork this and create a pull request if you know how to fix it.
